Introduction

My Story
  I started using rails finders
  sql substituion syntax
  I discovered hash conditionals
  Joined a code base with tons of raw sql
  repetative raw sql
  There has to be a better way

Why use arel and hash syntax exclusivly

What does active record give us
What does arel give us

What's new in Rails 4


------------

Using models as Query Objects
 - don't let where, joins, etc escape
Don't duplicate logic
 - merge
Scopes and chaining scopes
Handling complex joins
Better way to order by
like
not like
grouping conditionals
unions
Extending relationships
Agregate functions
Special Functions

Access Arel directly
